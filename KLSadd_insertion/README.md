##KLS Addendum Insertion Project

This project uses python and string manipulation to insert sections of the KLSadd.tex file into the appropriate DRMF chapter sections. The updateChapters.py program is the most recently updated and cleanest version, however it is not completed. Should be run with a simple call to 

python updateChapters.py

The linetest.py program is the original program file fully updated. It is much harder to read and should only be used as a reference to update the updateChapters.py program. 

NOTE: Both the updateChapters.py and linetest.py lack a pdf version of their chapter 14 output. One must be generated to view results. 

NOTE: The KLSadd.tex file only deals with chapters 9 and 14, as stated in the document itself.
