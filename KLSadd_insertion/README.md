##KLS Addendum Insertion Project

This project uses python and string manipulation to insert sections of the KLSadd.tex file into the appropriate DRMF chapter sections. The updateChapters.py program is the most recently updated and cleanest version, however it is not completed. Should be run with a simple call to 
```
python updateChapters.py
```
The program must have a tempchap9.tex and a tempchap14.tex as well as the KLSadd.tex file in the same directory!
The linetest.py program is the original program file fully updated. It is much harder to read and should only be used as a reference to update the updateChapters.py program. 

NOTE: Both the updateChapters.py and linetest.py lack a pdf version of their chapter 14 output. One must be generated to view results. 

NOTE: The KLSadd.tex file only deals with chapters 9 and 14, as stated in the document itself.

NOTE: when you run updateChapters.py or linetest.py you need the KLSadd.tex file, tempchap9.tex, and tempchap14.tex in order to run the program. The program *generates* updated9.tex and updated14.tex files. 

**THIS MEANS YOU SHOULD NOT RUN updateChapters.py OR linetest.py FROM YOUR GIT DIRECTORY. THE CHAPTER FILES ARE NOT PUBLIC DOMAIN, DO NOT COMMIT THEM! COPY THE FILES OVER INTO A SEPERATE DIRECTORY AND THEN COPY THEM BACK OVER WHEN YOU ARE READY TO COMMIT**
