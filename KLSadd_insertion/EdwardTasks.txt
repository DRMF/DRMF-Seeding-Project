Fix your github; hopefully fixed now (fixed if this message shows up on github)

https://help.github.com/categories/ssh/
go there and try to work out your issue, rm your git directory and try git clone again.


If all else fails, try ssh -vT git@github.com

ABOVE IS DONE |

This is what updateChapters.py currently does:

-rips paragraphs from KLSadd and puts them after the References paragraphs. 
TESTED: WORKING

This is what has been written but not implemented/tested:

-method to add relevant usepackages from KLSadd (cite, hyperref, xparse)
-method to add relevant new commands from KLSadd
-method to add "\large\bf KLSadd:" after every "paragraph{" inserted from KLSadd so everything looks neat

This is what needs to be written:
-method that inserts limit relations straight into the limit relations paragraph in relevant sections instead of just at the end of the section

keep checking back here every time I've commited to see what's left, and you can change stuff around here just add a comment saying what you did and the date you did it
